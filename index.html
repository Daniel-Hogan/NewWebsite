  <h2>A ranked list of all the subjects in my school based on how much I like them</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Computer Science</li>
    <li>Physics</li>
    <li>Calculus</li>
    <li>Gym/Health</li>
    <li>English</li>
    <li>History</li>
    <li>Spanish</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Reasoning</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1) I enjoy computer science a lot and although it can be frustrating it is satisfying</li>
    <li>2) I enjoy physics and it is as hard as calculus</li> 
    <li>3) The same reasoning as computer science however is less enjoyable</li>
    <li>4) I like gym because it is a good stress reliever</li>
    <li>5) I enjoy it more than History and Spanish so I have no choice but to put it here</li>
    <li>6) History is a lot of memorization which makes it difficult and not enjoyable</li>
    <li>7) Spanish is very confusing as it is difficult to learn a new langauge</li>
  </ul> 
  <p><strong>NOTE: For the purposes of this listing I did not count lunch as a subject (this would be at the top of my list).<br> I ranked these subjects solely on their contents and not if I have friends in those classes or liked the teachers.</strong></p>
